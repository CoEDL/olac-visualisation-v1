Interact with the map to find the languages in a specific region or browse via country using the side panel.\r\n\r\n# The app\r\n\r\nThe app is visible @ http://mlr-au.github.io/olac-visualisation/app/#/. In this version the data scraped from the language archives site is baked in however it is unlikely to ever be updated as this instance is for demonstration purposes only.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
